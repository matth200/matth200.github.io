Generally, I excel in coding and engineering (I'm known for my original ideas).
I am a self-driven learner and worker, evident in projects like this CV. 
If you peruse my GitHub, you'll find a few of these projects there.
Other than that I really love Cybersecurity and this is one of my number one interest in all my projects.




I am a highly motivated individual. Once I have an idea in mind or encounter a problem that eludes resolution,
I am compelled to persist until I succeed. This determination propels my continuous self-improvement.
I operate as a software entrepreneur, specializing in web, mobile, PC, and embedded software development.
Additionally, I collaborate with my school's Junior Enterprise, undertaking paid IT projects.
Presently, I am doing a master in Cybersecurity at the University of Nancy in France.
